== Frequently Asked Questions ==
<strong>Is there a detailed reference manual coming with the widget?</strong><br />
It is very easy. All you have to know about customizing and setting the widget is written in the manual. But if you need additional information write in the support.

<strong>Can I change the weather icon set?</strong>
Of course. Search the web, or draw your own icons and overwrite the default iconset. The deafault icon size is 57x57px

<strong>Can I change the weather background?</strong>
Yes, you can. The deafult height is 230px. You can overwrite it, in the img library

<strong>Does the widget slow down my side? How can I prevent this? </strong>
The weather forecast of a given location normally doesn´t change fastly. I built in a cache in the plugin. 
This helps in two things: The server of esotanc.hu doesn´t have to handle too many quests for weather data and your site should speed up a little bit, because your user will see the cached data!
